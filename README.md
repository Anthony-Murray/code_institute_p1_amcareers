## Design

  

### Design Choices

I researched other careers education / consultancy websites to for inspiration focusing on find a professional, responsive and clean layouts that aligned to my own vision. I based my site design on the layout of [The Code Insititutes](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) website. Although there are some examples of career coaching websites most (in my oponion) are pporly designed.

  

Engaging with parents to grab their attention needs to be done quickly. The imagery used on the site was chosen to grab their attention focusing on teenagers contempleating. The hero section includes a picture of the consultant to proivide proof and early evidence that there is a face behind the brand.

  

At the wireframing stage I decided to adopt a mobile first approach after reading this excellent article on [Browser Stack.](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-implement-mobile-first-design)

  

### Colours

Colour psychology plays an important role in webdesign. In choosing a colour combination I decided on blue and white on reading of the following article on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@bloominari/color-psychology-in-web-design-f60656b8f313). Recognising the importance of having a AAA compliant palette as recommended by the WCAG I choose #1b365d as the base colour as recommended here by the [University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/tel/resource/tel_website/accessiblecontrast/?q=FFFFFF~003b49~1d4289~94a596~e56db1~d3273e~00bfb2~d6d2c4~ffc845~dc582a~41b6e6~1b365d~be84a3~5d3754~7da1c4~f2c75c~d0d3d4~007a78~000000)

  

Primary Colours - Blue #1B365D / White #FFFFFF

Backgrounds - Light Grey #F0F0F0

Body Text - Black #1A1A1A

Button Hover - Dark Blue #101E39

  

These combinations were tested using [WebAIM's Contrast Checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

  

![Colour scheme](assets\docs\color_palette.png)

  

### Fonts

Oswald and Source Sans Pro were selected with the help of the [Font Pair](https://www.fontpair.co/all).

  

Oswald font is used for site headings and Source Sans Pro for the main body text. Both fonts use a sans-serif fallback.

  

### Structure

The primary website follows a one-page design divided into unique sections. The sections are as follows:

  

- A header section containing the business logo and responsive navigation menu.

- A hero section containing a description and image to convey the purpose of the site. An image of the consultant is used to build trust with the visitor. A call to action button is included to encourage the user to contact for a free 15 minute consulation which directs to the contact form.

- A services section to provide brief descriptions of the services the consultant provides and a call to action button to encourage the user to contact the consultant for a no obligation consultation which directs to the contact form.

- A client testimonials section to provide evidence of the consultant's expertise and build trust with the visitor.

- A contact section which provides a contact form to allow the user to contact the consultant with questions or to request a quote, a Google map displaying the consultant's location and further contact details including a phone number and email address.

- A footer section which social media links, copyright notice, and a link to the site owner's GitHub page.

  

### Wireframes

I used Adobe XD to create my wireframes. I created wireframes for mobile and desktop. I used the mobile first approach to design the site.

### Features Left to Implement

The following features could be implemented in the future to provide users with more detailed information and further build prospective client trust through the website:

  

- To improve SEO each service could have its own page with more detailed information about the service and the benefits of the service to the client. This would also allow the consultant to target more keywords related to each service.

- A Blog feature could further build trust with prospective clients by allowing the consultant to share articles related to career guidance and coaching. This would also benefit SEO.

- A FAQ section could be added to answer common questions.

- A chatbot could be added to improve user experience

- A hamburger menu could be added to improve user experience on mobile devices (I tried to implement this through CSS but there were signigcant accseability issues).

- The CTA button on the hero section should have centered on smaller devices. I tried to implement this through CSS but was constrained by time.

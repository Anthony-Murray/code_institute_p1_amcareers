## Design

### Design Choices
I researched other careers education / consultancy websites to for inspiration focusing on find a professional, responsive and clean layouts that aligned to my own vision. I based my site design on the layout of [The Code Insititutes](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) website. Although there are some examples of career coaching websites most (in my oponion) are pporly designed.

Engaging with parents to grab their attention needs to be done quickly. The imagery used on the site was chosen to grab their attention focusing on teenagers contempleating. The hero section includes a picture of the consultant to proivide proof and early evidence that there is a face behind the brand.

At the wireframing stage I decided to adopt a mobile first approach after reading this excellent article on [Browser Stack.](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-implement-mobile-first-design)

### Colours
Colour psychology plays an important role in webdesign. In choosing a colour combination I decided on blue and white on reading of the following article on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@bloominari/color-psychology-in-web-design-f60656b8f313). Recognising the importance of having a AAA compliant palette as recommended by the WCAG I choose #1b365d as the base colour as recommended here by the [University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/tel/resource/tel_website/accessiblecontrast/?q=FFFFFF~003b49~1d4289~94a596~e56db1~d3273e~00bfb2~d6d2c4~ffc845~dc582a~41b6e6~1b365d~be84a3~5d3754~7da1c4~f2c75c~d0d3d4~007a78~000000)

Primary Colours - Blue #1B365D  / White #FFFFFF
Backgrounds - Light Grey #F0F0F0
Body Text - Black #1A1A1A
Button Hover - Dark Blue #101E39

These combinations was tested using [WebAIM's Contrast Checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Fonts
Oswald and Source Sans Pro were selected with the help of the [Font Pair](https://www.fontpair.co/all). 

Oswald font is used for site headings and Source Sans Pro for the main body text. Both fonts use a sans-serif fallback.

### Wireframes
I used Adobe XD to create my wireframes. I created wireframes for mobile and desktop. I used the mobile first approach to design the site.
